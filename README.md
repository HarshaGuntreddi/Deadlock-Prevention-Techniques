# Deadlock Prevention Techniques

## üìå Description
This Java-based project implements efficient deadlock prevention techniques for multi-threaded applications. It provides algorithms to detect, prevent, and resolve deadlocks using resource ordering, timeout mechanisms, and priority-based allocation, ensuring smooth concurrent execution.This project implements various **deadlock prevention techniques** in Java. It demonstrates strategies to avoid deadlocks in concurrent programming by implementing multiple algorithms and testing them under different scenarios.

## üî• Features
- **Hold and Wait Prevention**: Allocates all required resources at once.
- **Circular Wait Prevention**: Enforces resource ordering to prevent circular dependencies.
- **Timeout-Based Deadlock Prevention**: Uses timeouts while acquiring locks to avoid indefinite waiting.
- **Priority-Based Allocation**: Allocates resources based on process priority.
- **Database Locking Simulation**: Simulates database deadlock prevention using row and table locking.
- **Distributed Deadlock Prevention**: Implements unique global resource ordering for distributed systems.
- **Starvation Prevention**: Uses fair locks to ensure resource fairness.
- **Resource Ordering with Priority**: Assigns resource locks based on predefined priorities.
- **Wait-Die & Wound-Wait Schemes**: Implements classical deadlock avoidance strategies.
- **Deadlock Detection Algorithm**: Uses cycle detection in a resource allocation graph.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: Java's `Lock` and `ReentrantLock` for thread synchronization.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Used for deadlock detection.
